        <p><em>Graduate <strong>Tech Elevator</strong> Coding Bootcamp</em></p>
        <p>I got a bachelor's degree in history only because I have always been interested in the history of countries
          and
          peoples. Thanks to my curiosity, I have visited 16 countries at the moment.
          I came to the Tech Elevator to complete another of my old dream, to become a programmer. Studying here was a
          natural
          step toward achieving this goal.
          I wanted to know how the code works. Not just to learn, but also to become a professional in the field of
          coding.
          That is why I chose Tech Elevator, one of the best boot camps in the country. Where else but here I will get
          the
          best knowledge and skills demanded by employers, as evidenced by many hundreds of successfully employed
          graduates of
          this boot camp? By graduating from Tech Elevator, I also hope to be a successfully hired graduate with
          marketable
          skills.
          I am a dreamer and implementer at the same time, who wants to succeed in life and passionately strive for the
          desired better future.</p>
